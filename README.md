# tommy2tommy

A small personal playground for deep learning. More to follow.

This repository is highly inspired by the excellent [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor](tensor2tensor).

## Testing

To run all unit tests, execute the following command from the top-level directory:

```shell
pytest --disable-warnings tommy2tommy/
```
